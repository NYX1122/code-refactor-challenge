For this project I organized and refactored the unorganized source code of a website that did meet accessibility standards or utilitze semantic elements.
The index.html file in this repository now uses semantic elements, proper indentation, and alt attributes for photos. I also ensured that header elements were utilized sequentially and added a proper title to the page.
The style.css file in this repository now displays structured CSS in the order that elements appear on the web-page, along with comments describing each style choice and which elements they are being applied to.
